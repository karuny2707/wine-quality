# wine-quality
In this contemporary world, consumers and sellers are keen about the quality of
product produced and accurate certification of the authenticity is required. The objective of this
study is to develop and evaluate a predictive model that accurately estimates key characteristics
of wines based on their chemical composition and other relevant attributes. To accomplish wine
prediction, different machine learning algorithms are used, including regression and
classification techniques. Our proposed system ensures to provide a feasible solution with the
most efficient results, which makes the process hassle free
